Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Customer mobile reviews using Web scrapping

Scapy is used for web scrapping customer reviews of 10 different mobile products. 
It scraps:
1. Name of customer
2. Title of review
3. Rating of Review
4. Text of review
The code for scrapping is present in /Scrape_AmazonReviews/spiders/amazon_reviews.py
If you want to scrape different products then goto above file and change the links in url_list. Also update the range of i to control the page number
